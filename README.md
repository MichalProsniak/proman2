Well, we are closing up on Trello so we can go for world domination soon!

You did a decent job on your first sprint of ProMan. The backlog already
contains all our feature requests, I only have one more:

Deploy the app by the end of the sprint, so we can start promoting it.

Just as last week, send us the sprint backlog ASAP, and we'll meet at the demo.

Remember, quality work is a must, we want to conquer the world with this new product!

Oh and I hope you've learnt from Jacob's mistake about arriving late to the office...
